# NASA API Automation Project ðŸš€

I built an API automation project using NASAâ€™s open APIs, including the Astronomy Picture of the Day and Near Earth Object services. The test suite was designed using Python and Pytest, with data-driven test cases targeting multiple query parameters like date and celestial body information. To showcase the project, I created and deployed a lightweight dashboard using GitHub Pagesâ€”perfect for demonstrating test coverage and giving a visual sneak peek into the automation process.
